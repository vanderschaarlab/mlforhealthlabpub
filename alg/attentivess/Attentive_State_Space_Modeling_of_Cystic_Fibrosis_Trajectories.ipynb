We notice also that depression is quite prevalent in Stage 3 since this is the terminal stage of the disease. Moreoer, we can see a huge difference in the risk of diabetes and hypertension in patients in Stage 1 compared to those in Stages 2 and 3.

This means that most relevant time steps for whcih clinical decisions are made, non-Markov models are required!"

Unlike implicit generative models, our model is an explicit generative model that suffers no privacy concern as it does not memorize any individual trajectory in the original dataset. To sample from the trained model, we can use the **sample** API as follows:"
