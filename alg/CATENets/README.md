This repo contains Jax-based, sklearn-style implementations of Neural Network-based Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) Estimators, which were used in the AISTATS 2021 paper 'Nonparametric Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: From Theory to Learning Algorithms' (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10943).

We implement the SNet-class we introduce in our AISTATS paper, and re-implement a number of NN-based algorithms from existing literature (Shalit et al (2017), Shi et al (2019), Hassanpour & Greiner (2020)). We also provide NN-based instantiations of a number of so-called meta-learners for CATE estimation, including two-step pseudo-outcome regression estimators (the DR-learner (Kennedy, 2020) and single-robust propensity-weighted (PW) and regression-adjusted (RA) learners), Nie & Wager (2017)'s R-learner and Kuenzel et al (2019)'s X-learner.

### Installation

```bash
$ pip install catenets
```



### Usage
All implemented learning algorithms (``TNet, SNet, SNet1, SNet2, SNet3, DRNet, RANet, PWNet, RNet, XNet``) come with a sklearn-style wrapper, implementing a ``.fit(X, y, w)`` and a ``.predict(X)`` method, where predict returns CATE by default. All hyperparameters are documented in detail in the respective files in the .models folder.

Example usage:

```python
from catenets.models import TNet, SNet
from catenets.experiments.simulation_utils import simulate_treatment_setup

# simulate some data (here: unconfounded, 10 prognostic variables and 5 predictive variables)
X, y, w, p, cate = simulate_treatment_setup(n=2000, n_o=10, n_t=5, n_c=0)

# estimate CATE using TNet
t = TNet()
t.fit(X, y, w)
cate_pred_t = t.predict(X) # without potential outcomes
cate_pred_t, po0_pred_t, po1_pred_t = t.predict(X, return_po=True) # predict potential outcomes too

# estimate CATE using SNet
s = SNet(penalty_orthogonal=0.01)
s.fit(X, y, w)
cate_pred_s = s.predict(X)

```

All experiments in the AISTATS paper can be replicated using this repository; the necessary code is in ``catenets.experiments.simulations_AISTATS`` and ``catenets.experiments.ihdp_experiments``. To do so from shell, clone the repo, create a new virtual environment and run
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt #install requirements
python run_experiments.py
```
```shell
Options:
--experiment # defaults to 'simulation', 'ihdp' will run ihdp experiments
--setting # different simulation settings in synthetic experiments (can be 1-5)
--models # defaults to None which will train all models considered in paper,
         # can be string of model name (e.g 'TNet'), 'plug' for all plugin models,
         # 'pseudo' for all pseudo-outcome regression models

--file_name # base file name to write to, defaults to 'results'
--n_repeats # number of experiments to run for each configuration, defaults to 10 (should be set to 100 for IHDP)
```
To run the ihdp experiments, first download the IHDP-100 data files from https://www.fredjo.com/ and place them in a folder called 'data/'.

The code can also be installed as a python package (``catenets``). From a local copy of the repo, run ``python setup.py install``.

Note: jax is currently only supported on macOS and linux, but can be run from windows using WSL (the windows subsystem for linux).
