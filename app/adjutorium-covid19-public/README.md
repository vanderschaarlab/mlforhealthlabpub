# Cambridge Adjutorium (for COVID-19)

## Introduction

Cambridge Adjutorium is an AI-powered tool that accurately predicts how COVID-19 will impact resource needs (ventilators, ICU beds, etc.) at the individual patient level and the hospital level, thereby giving a reliable picture of future resource usage and enabling healthcare professionals to make well-informed decisions about how these scarce resources can be used to achieve the maximum benefit.

A detailed introduction with video demonstration is available [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/partnering-nhs-digital-public-health-england-mihaela-van-der-schaar/).

Note that the included data is synthetic to ensure that the demo runs.

## Usage

Please first make sure you have installed all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

A web demo is available by running `main_index.py`. All figures presented in the demo are based on synthetic data for illustrative purposes only.

The model training and prediction scripts are in the folder `model_training`. 
The users will need to manage data importing and feature cleaning themselves as we are not able to provide the data set.
